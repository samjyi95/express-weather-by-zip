# Deliverable: Become a Weather Forecaster

You have the current temperature printing out for any location a user can come up with. Cool! But the Weather-JS response gives you so much more data than just that!

Take this app and enhance it to give me a 5-day forecast (that's the `forecast` section!) complete with styling, and weather icons.

**Your completed deliverable is:**

* Styled with cards, tables, or rectangular borders that look like a real weather site, like [Accuweather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/white-center-wa/98106/weather-forecast/341384) or [Kiro7 News](https://www.kiro7.com/weather-detail?mapID=12404077). (Try out [Materialize cards](https://materializecss.com/cards.html) if you are stylistically inclined!)
* 5 day forecast, where each day includes:
    * High and Low Predicted Temperatures
    * Day of the week
    * Date
    * Description 
    * Percent chance of precipitation

## BONUS

* An icon based on their recommendation (Try [unicode characters](http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_weather_symbols.html) for basic weather symbols) or you can find an icon set if you wish!
* Use moment to make your date fancy
